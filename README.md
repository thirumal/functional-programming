# Functional Programming
When I dip my finger about some concept in functional programming, it makes it way here

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## [fp-scala](fp-scala)
This contains stuff I coded up while I was working through [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) Coursera course.

Please read through the [README](fp-scala/README.md) file present inside that folder.

## [sicp](sicp)
This contains stuff I coded up while I was reading the [MIT SICP book](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html). There's a (quite long) [README](sicp/README.md) file inside the folder. Do go through it if you want to go through the code in order of occurrence in the book.

Finished a chapter and a half till now, still **work in progress**
