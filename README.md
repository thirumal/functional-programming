# Functional Programming
When I dip my finger about some concept in functional programming, it makes it way here

## sicp
This contains stuff I coded up while I was reading the [MIT SICP book](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html). There's a (quite long) README file inside the folder. Do go through it if you want to go through the code in order of occurrence in the book.
Finished a chapter and a half till now, still **incomplete**

## fp-scala
This contains stuff I coded up while I was working through
