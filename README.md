## sicp
This contains stuff I coded up while I was reading the [MIT SICP book](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html). There's a (quite long) README file inside the folder. Do go through it if you want to go through the code in order of occurrence in the book.

## fp-scala
This contains stuff I coded up while I was working through
[Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) Coursera course.
This folder does not contain exercise solutions for the course, I don't want to contribute to feeding the cheaters.

## scala-school
Things I coded up when I was working through Twitter's [Scala School](http://twitter.github.io/scala_school/) tutorial
